## Description

"En Spam" blocks comments and form submissions from bots using cookies and JavaScript. Bots cannot use cookies or JavaScript, and therefore they are blocked.  

Visitors blocking cookies or JavaScript can still comment by transferring to a special page.  

The plugin protects the following:
- Elementor Pro forms.
- Contact Form 7 (CF7) forms.
- Default WordPress comments.

The plugin operates transparently, ensuring regular users are not inconvenienced while effectively blocking bots.  

Additionally, you can track how many spambots have been blocked using a dashboard widget.  

*"En Spam"* means "have not spam" in Hebrew.

## Installation

1. Upload the `en-spam` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Alternatively, you can install it via the WordPress Admin Panel.
